### Experience
>First of all I started learning HTML, CSS and JS at BSU, where I'm currently studying. After passing the exam in this discipline, I decided to try myself in web development. I went to work as an intern, first to one person in an incomprehensible IT company, and then to another, with the hope that I would be taught at least something there. My expectations were not met. Then I began to gain experience on my own as a freelancer.
